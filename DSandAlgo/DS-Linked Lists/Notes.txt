DS - Linked Lists

Linked Lists = consist of Nodes(value and pointer), value is the value contained, pointer is reference to the next node in the list
			   eg. apples --> orange --> peach --> plum --> null

What are the advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays and Hash Tables?
	-No need to constantly increase of size list
	-Inserting and Deleting from head or tail is O(1) time, swaping of pointers
	-Inserting and Deleting at specific position doesnt require shifting

Big O
	Prepend = O(1) add to the head
	Append = O(1) add to to the tail
	Lookup = O(n) looking for a item
	Insert = O(n) at specific spot
	Delete = O(n) at specific spot
