Algorithms - Recursion

Recursion =  a function that call itself

Base Case = causes the function to stop calling itself

3 rules:
	1. Identify the base case
	2. Identify the recursive case
	3. Move closer and closer towards the best case

Rules: When to use Recursion
	- Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion
	- Problem allows for divsion of problems into smaller instances of the same problem
	- Each instance of the problem is identical in nature
	- The solutions of the each sub-problem can be combined to solve teh problem at hand
	- Divide and Conquer using Recursion
