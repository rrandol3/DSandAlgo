DS: Stacks & Queues

Stacks = LIFO, Last In First Out, eg. stack of plates or call stack
		Big O:
			- lookup = O(n)
			- pop(remove top of the stack) = O(1)
			- push(add item to the stack) = O(1)
			- peek(get top of stack without removing) = O(1)

Queues = FIFO, First In First Out, eg. line at the grocery store, printers... 
		Big O:
			- lookup = O(n)
			- enqueue(add item to back of list) = O(1)
			- dequeue(remove item from the front of list) = O(1)
			- peek(get item from front without removing) = O(1)
