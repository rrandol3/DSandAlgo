 Algorithms - Dynamic Programming

 Dynamic Programming = optimization technique using cache (Divide & Conquer + Memoization)

 Caching = a way to store values so that you can use them later on

 Memoization = a specific form of caching that involves caching the return value (a way to remember a solution to sub problem)

 Rules
	1. Can be divide into sub problems
	2. Recursive Solution
	3. Are there repetive sub problems
	4. Memoize sub problems
	5. Demand a raise from your boss
