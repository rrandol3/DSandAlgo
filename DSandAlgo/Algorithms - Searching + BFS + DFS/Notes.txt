Algorithms - Searching BFS + DFS

Linear Search = checks each item in the list to find match
	Time = O(n)

Binary Search = items have to sorted, divide conquer, split array into left and right arrays, check to see if itemToFind is greater or less than mid item
				if less, repeat process seach the left, else repeat process searching the right
	Time = O(log n)
