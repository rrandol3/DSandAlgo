DS: Hash Table

Hash Table - based on key value pair, uses hash function create location address for key value pair, no guaranteed order

Big O - insert O(1)
		lookup O(1), maybe be O(n) if there is collision
		delete O(1)
		search O(1)

Collisions - when 2 or more items are saved to the same location
			 ways to resolve:
				seperate chaining via linked list

Examples in C# - 
				Dictionary(strongly typed), eg. Dictonary<int, string>, key has to be unique
				Hashtable(weekly typed), eg. new Hashtable(), key has to be unique
				Hashset(stongly type), eg. only keeps unique items added to the set, only stores keys
