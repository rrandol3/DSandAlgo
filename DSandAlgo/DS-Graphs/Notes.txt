DS-Graphs

Graphs = composed of Nodes and Edges
		Nodes - the items in the Graph
		Edges - connects the Nodes

Types of Graphs:
	Directed - only goes in one direction, eg. 1 way street
	Undirected - can go in both directions, eg. highway between to cities
	Weighted - contains values on Edges, eg. shortest path with Google maps
	Unweighted - Edges simply show connection, eg. course prereqs. 
	Cyclic - when Nodes(vertices) are connected in a circular fashion(contains cycles), eg. roads
	Acyclic - contains no cycles, eg. course prereqs.
